# MakeKit CMake file for custom build types
# Keep in mind, that CMake BUILD_TYPEs are case-insensitive, thus
# it doesn't make difference between lowercase and uppercase characters.
# The following build type names are protected by CMake: None, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel.
# You can inherit from another build types by listing their flags variable (like ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG}) in your custom flags.
