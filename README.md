# MakeKit

**MakeKit is a tool to make the cross-platform compilation of modern C/C++ simple.** It relies on the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system generator, the [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) build system, and the [LLVM/clang](http://llvm.org) compiler infrastructure to achieve:

- Cross-platform, uniform, out of the box behavior :sparkles:
- Providing simple, low-maintenance build configurations
- Integration with popular integrated development environments (IDEs)
- Support of cross-platform compilation of modern C/C++
- Support of parallel technologies OpenMP, OpenCL and CUDA
- Support of graphics APIs OpenGL and Vulkan
- Support of the cross-platform windowing framework Qt 5
- Support of the swiss army knife library Boost

**The project is at an early stage, so if you find any issue or you could simply add something, please contribute.**
